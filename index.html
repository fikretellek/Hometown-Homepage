                    back to 3rd century BC. Until 74 BC, it was one of the most important cities belonging to Bithynia,
                    which included Bilecik, Bolu, Sakarya, Kocaeli. It was conquered by Pontus and then by the Roman
                    Empire. During the Roman period the city was influenced by Latin culture, and it changed its name to
                    Prusias ad Hypium. Later on Christianity affected the city and after the separation of the Roman
                    Empire in 395, it was controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire (the later Byzantine Empire).</h6>
